### SeoulBikeData

I performed visualisation using Tableau on the dataset SeoulBikeData to get some insights about the rented bike counts across different variables. The data consists of bikes rented throughout the year of 2018 and during the winter season of 2017. A total of 61,72,314 bikes were rented according to data that we have. Date, Rented Bike Count, Hour, Temperature(°C), Humidity(%), Wind speed (m/s), Visibility (10m), Dew point temperature(°C), Solar Radiation (MJ/m2), Rainfall(mm), Snowfall (cm), Seasons, Holiday and Functioning Day.

I have observed the Rented Bikes across two categories of variables first, depending on Hours, Days, Seasons; second, depending on the weather, such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, Visibility, Dew point temperature, Solar Radiation, Rainfall, Snowfall.
##### Graphs wrt to Hours,Days and Seasons

##### Graphs wrt to different Weather

The reason for observing these variables was to know how the rented bike count was dependent and how these variables affected the number of bikes rented.

Understanding these trends is important because then we come to know on which factors it varies. It helps us to make decisions regarding the rented bikes to come up with potential ways to improve it.



### Graphs wrt to Hours,Days and Seasons

### Seasons Vs %Total Rented Bike Count

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7vHRBJY9KCWi_EjGmmtjCLdAc6VAEB4p6OsgKAuxZVMTVxXtSER--icjMBkN1m41XCooIX7Jvq2Xm-WqD7654WnPSw6WMmzhr_r4jrlXyb998mnSqw_t6RyJyFrcOF9RnHckdW7z)

**Description**: From the graph, it is evident that the least percent of bikes were rented in the winter and that maximum bikes were rented in the summer season. This aligns with the general thought that people do not prefer riding on a bike in winter as much as they would during other times. In this plot I have filtered out the winter season 2017 so that we can clearly observe the rented bike percentage across all seasons uniformly.

**Insight**: The number of bike count in winter is very less maybe due to the cold weather.

**Possible solutions/suggestions**: Giving a pair of good winter gloves, providing proper lights for the bikes, coming up with special rates for the winter season, and providing coupons.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Holiday/No Holiday

**Description**: It is noticed that very few of these bikes were rented when there was a holiday. Majority of the bikes were rented when there was no holiday. This helps us understand if the bikes were rented for sports/leisure activities or for some kind of work.

**Insight**: As there is significant difference in the number of bikes being rented in holidays compared to when there was no holiday, we can say that it's possible that the bikes were rented majorly for work related purposes.

**Possible solutions/suggestions**: Coming up with some family discounts, special schemes for holidays.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Holiday/No Holiday across different Seasons

**Description**: The graph gives us an understanding if people preferred renting bikes on holidays as well in any particular season. It is helpful to know if the sales are less on holidays altogether or if seasons have a role to play with it. This can help us to come up with schemes accordingly.

**Insight**: Looking at this graph, it is also interesting to know that people preferred cycling even on holidays in summer compared to the other seasons. So in the summer season it did not really matter if it was a holiday or a non holiday, the sales were almost equal. However in other season the sales were less on holidays.

Possible solutions/suggestions: Since the bike renting is not affected much in the summers, for now focusing on increasing sales for other seasons, especially winter should be kept in mind.

### Sum of Rented Bike Count Vs Hour

**Description**: The bikes rented can be further observed on an hourly basis. This bar chart shows that there is a greater number of bikes being rented at 6:00 in evening and at 8:00 in the morning.

**Insight**:The reason for this could be people are using bikes for travelling to work,  schools, or for exercising.

### Sum of Rented Bike Count Vs Hour across Different Seasons

**Description**: A similar pattern can be observed throughout all seasons. The reason to check this was to find out if the bike count across hours varied similarly in all seasons or if there was any exception to it.

**Insight**: An interesting thing which can be observed is that during noon time, from 11:00 to 4:00, there is not much difference comparatively in the rented bikes in summer, autumn and spring seasons. Hence season doesnt play a role in bike counts determination for those hours.

### Graphs wrt to different Weather

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Temperature(in celsius)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AkEwHqwWBXxJR6bzealZdqpzs2dLzp4xj5iRSIpe3o7NzHbrWfZiBXfz2VoKQ3h91mHrcZOB0MPlElqmKblMbLmKVdlOGlEk3GeIVrO-a1JxygcEK4CjRpDb509IwksW1TA3JJz7)

**Description**: This visualisation shows how the rented bikes are affected by temperature.

**Insight**: We can see that when the temperature is too low or too high the number of bikes rented are less. Between 15 degrees and 27 degrees temperature, it can be seen that there was a peak and more bikes were rented. This makes sense as people would generally not prefer renting a bike if its too cold or too hot. The less number of bikes rented when the temperature is below 5 or 10 explains the less number of bikes rented in winter. The trend line is a polynomial equation with degree 4. 

**Possible solutions/suggestions**: It is possible to provide the renters with complimentary energy drinks and protein bars and enable the bikes to have a place to keep them on bike.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Rainfall

**Description**: This visualisation shows how rainfall affects the rented bike counts. Since the dataset had lots of values in mm, when it rained, Rainfall(mm), but the count of each of these values was very less, hence I clubbed it into two categories: when it rained and when it did not rain. Again the reason here was to know if the bike renting is affected by the rainfall.

**Insight**: It aligns with the thought that people would prefer renting bikes when it's not raining versus when it is.

**Possible solutions/suggestions**: It is suggested to check once if this trend is observed due to preference of people or if the bikes are not capable of being used during rains.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Snowfall

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/spB3QNYr_P5P3i9QEumkGX9wlN_c2itCi7spwJEd2PtBwfzlCKBkfh5CSmQJuX9z7VBq_gSRkb7WhazbBorncGRV0lLYASiAnXHPz8nju5RqCgBn5_PgRRYi8IryazZAZ4kimd-8)

**Description**: This visualisation shows how rainfall affects the rented bike counts. Since the dataset had lots of values in cm, when it snowed, Snowfall(cm), but the count of each of these values was very less, hence I clubbed it into two categories: when it snowed and when it did not snow. Again the reason here was to know if the bike renting is affected by the snowfall.

**Insight**: It aligns with the thought that people would prefer renting bikes when it's not snowing versus when it is.

**Possible solutions/suggestions**: It is suggested to check once if this trend is observed due to preference of people or if the bikes are not capable of being used during snows. Check for the tiresif they can be used in snow safely, brakes etc.

### Average of Rented Bike Count Vs Humidity(%)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cS0f8EVSyRXbVU4HytEBGHXWPW94qo5BhctIi8O79jVKU_5A2gPN_hOwUd74Q4gKU1NU2ezVVLDk-LvKkmh-BNBTY0GMcJoXHXxv50cZcDOTar3jCrh3gTASpmk7o4nTKHtUbAVJ)

**Description**: We can also see if humidity had any particular effects on the bikes being rented.

**Insight**: It seems like humidity does not really play a role in determining the bikes being rented in general.

### Average of Rented Bike Count Vs Wind Speed(m/s)

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lOWuErT-O-DPCNgqN1wbCzFSreHfS0uvsthJ3m0qOIPya9HiZMprkB02biQFf7S_7j-OndBjqARHU9H4zZx8dYN4Ifi2pbKiwkOFctInzsPM892FvojKpYOADYrWSZwishxiTRMm)

**Description**: The graph can help us know if it's windy then do people prefer renting bikes or if they don't.

**Insight**:It can be said that there is no particular pattern which can be observed between the rented bike count and wind speed.

### Average of Rented Bike Count Vs Visibiity

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hwhoRA2GWlZyf17AJwBaAQyy_mwTdOr9xChRNcDX9Sr4OrO4hCG3O7w-rTxhl0VyWC6qCEDe-f7UXGWGgyRMa7eRPuNvq4K37_FqUfe1UcxdeYsKrzUvmAWELNJQ-VMVSIxkkOHA)

**Description**: We can also see how visibility affects the bikes rented. People would not prefer and will find it difficult to ride a bike when the visibility is not great.

**Insight**: However from the graph we can see that visibility is not really a good measure to know how many bikes would be rented as there is no particular pattern between visibility and the rented bike count.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Solar Radiation

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ht7fbpfCLaL9vDOmwSdIk9-qnHM-BfAnCWSioL2idE9cVwQ0ekkF-0hDZ55LSfTjJ45x4rkIrsUy0bPxFEEc6vWvpCjKKReO72dcLs2GJ28X1v_A2SGuBM3p7uIr8iwsX9Iv3IRl)

**Description**: We can also see if Solar Radiation affects the number of bikes being rented. Since there were lots of varying values for solar radiations, I grouped them into Solar Radtion 1 meaning there was some kind of Solar Radiation present or Solar Radiation 0 meaning there was no Solar Radiation.

**Insight**: Solar Radiation definitely affects the number of bikes being rented. It is evident from the above graph that in its presence there are a greater number of bikes which are rented than in its absence.

### Average Rented Bike Count Vs Solar Radiation in different Seasons

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xx1pBkQ7g_a39cos22nR4SjF7CmnuKmn7aXp6ligd-AnRYQuxPS8akby75JQ8_vL0VdDoU0ofVPNdv-QpLfeEmQXlofjDwhjLsXQGMaiOI_PuDrbhweBfMnG2TGFaAuTP0SdUuxC)

**Description**: Since we know that there is a relation between Solar Radiations presence and absence we can also try to check if it affects in all seasons or it affects only in particular seasons or if there is some exceptional relation in some season. We can also see how solar radiations affect the number of bikes being rented especially in summers and winters. The colour red represents Summer, blue represents Autumn, yellow represents Spring and green represent Winter. 

**Insight**: So we can expect a greater number of bikes being rented if a day is sunny compared to the other days when it's not sunny in any season. There is no exceptional pattern for any season here. Across all seasons, a sunny day will have higher count of bikes being rented than when there is no sun.

### Average of Rented Bike Count Vs Dew Point Temperature

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QPvHQktXcuC9mY0J54qKrP3BpWQJq7ZnCoz_KOcjDqhSPhzBC9H6_G18ijwFE6_hueolQEcDvmE5B9atGy4HWZe24ITUxsrAEKQmCQR-e0YK-hWDhbioTlgxyUuTTpdEjfT_yf-I)

**Description**: We can also check if the dew point has some kind of relation with the number of bikes being rented.

**Insight**: The graph is similar to that of temperature vs average rented bike count. So temperature and dew point temperature can be considered to be more or less same. Both have a similar effect on the bikes being rented.

### Correlation Matrix 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pDMkkVccLuMIqbqKKeBmcETAHgt3EWm-5lwW6u4fTw4msm7qqNlaTzMBtjAidqw0eoNhwPQ-8l4Lyb-R9PUlXtmIdKyvgDpX0u2LDoelvUovfjwhXl4kvm_xzbJGWMocaAUoHT5B)

Using python in which I used seaborn and matplotlib, I created this correlation matrix .

### Conclusion

From the graphs that we visualised and also after looking at the correlation matrix, we can now say that the number of bikes being rented highly depends on the hour and also on the temperature. Solar Radiation also has an effect on the bikes being rented.  It seems that people are renting bike for work related purposes and prefer to use bikes more in the non winter seasons, especially in summers. The correlation matrix further supports our findings.
